/**
 * This file is used to initialise a global tracing provider and span exporter
 * for our tests used in our project. This was the only way I was able to get
 * the tracing tests to work.
 *
 * Now before each test related or touches Opentelemetry
 * we are resetting the exporter defined below to ensure there are no spans
 * from previous tests still in memory. This is achived by calling `reset`
 * on the exporter in the unit tests while keeping one instance of
 * the trace provider and exporter.
 *
 * The tracing provider is being registered as a global trace provider before
 * we are importing our actual code which uses the Opentelemetry API to ensure
 * its defined beforehand.
