/**
 * When executing an async function, the Node runtime is really getting
 * a Promise; these are guaranteed not to complete until another cycle of
 * the event loop (at least the micro-loop). This can be problematic for
 * ordered queue receipts, since the library doesn't take special pains to
 * deliver the messages one at a time to async functions (they all push
 * through in one go, which just results in a bunch of outstanding Promises).
 *
 * This helper acts as a funnel for the subscriber so that it can do the
 * normal "push all the messages" as before, but each message will be
 * allowed to process fully before the next message is delivered to user code.
 *
 * This should not be used for non-async handlers. It's not being built
 * into the library itself, because it's difficult for us to second-guess
 * what users might want in a given situation. This lets you decide explicitly.
 * (Also, event handlers for on() are not something we have direct access
 * to, so guessing whether it's a Promise and waiting on it would be difficult.)
 *
 * @private
 * @internal
 * @example
 * ```
 * const {PubSub, AsyncHelper} = require('@google-cloud/pubsub');
 * const pubsub = new PubSub();
 *
 * const sub = pubsub.subscription('my-sub');
 * const helper = new AsyncHelper(async (m) => console.log(m));
 * sub.on('message', helper.handler);
 * ```
